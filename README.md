# SII Project: Fire Hydrant Crisis Simulation in Münster

## Project Overview
This project simulates the potential impact of fire hydrant failures in Münster, specifically in the Kneipenstraße area. The goal is to identify areas that are particularly vulnerable if a fire hydrant fails or is damaged.

## Use Case Scenario
### Research Question
*"Which areas in Münster are particularly at risk if a fire hydrant fails or is damaged?"*
## Use Case Scenario
### Research Question
*"Which areas in Münster are particularly at risk if a fire hydrant fails or is damaged?"*

### Application Case
- Effective fire service depends on functioning hydrants.
- The failure of one or more hydrants could significantly impair firefighting in certain areas.
- This simulation helps authorities identify risk areas and take preventive measures.

### Own Dataset (Simulation Data)
- **Calculated Damage Radius for Each Hydrant**
- **Generated by Python Script `hydranten_schadensradius.py`**
  - Reads the OSM data.
  - Creates buffer zones (damage radii) around each hydrant.
  - Converts the data into a **GeoPackage (.gpkg)**.

|-----------------|-------------------------------------|----------------|
| `id`            | Unique ID of the hydrant            | Integer        |
| `radius_m`        | Calculated damage radius (m)        | Float          |
| `type`          | Type of hydrant                     | String         |
| `geometry`   | Geographic coordinates              | Point (Lat, Lng) |


### Data Format & Storage
